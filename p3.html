<p>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language.<br>
It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."<br>
In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.<br>
C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features.<br>
Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes."<br>
However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>

<h4>Program to Add Two Integers</h4>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;<br>
int main()<br>
{  int firstNumber, secondNumber, sumOfTwoNumbers;<br>
   
    cout << "Enter two integers: ";<br>
    cin >> firstNumber >> secondNumber;<br>

    // sum of two numbers in stored in variable sumOfTwoNumbers<br>
    sumOfTwoNumbers = firstNumber + secondNumber;<br>

    // Prints sum <br>
    cout << firstNumber << " + " <<  secondNumber << " = " << sumOfTwoNumbers;    <br> 

    return 0;}
